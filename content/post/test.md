    I have no religion but I like Christmas cause we have holidays and it has cozy vibe.

Q8: Do you ever feel lonely?

    This is another dumb question but I should answer it seriously. Yes, I feel lonely. But I'm not the only one to have this feeling. In fact, we're all lonely. We were borned alone, and we will die alone.
    
Q9: What’s the most meaningful relationship you’ve ever had?

Q10: Do you have any toxic traits you’re not proud of?

    No matter how many good qualities a person has, it's doomed if they don't communicate openly and speak their feelings.
